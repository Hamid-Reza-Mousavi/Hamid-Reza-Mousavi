I'm `Hamid Reza`, hailing from the beautiful city of Isfahan, Iran 🏠. As a `petroleum engineer` with over three years of hands-on experience in programming 💻, `machine learning (ML)`, and `deep learning (DL)`, I've navigated and conquered a range of complex projects. My innovative approach and technical expertise have been the driving forces behind my success in the field.
